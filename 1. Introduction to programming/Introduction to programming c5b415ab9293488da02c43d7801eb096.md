# What are programming languages? Why do we need them?

Internally everything is 0s and 1s in computers. Say I want to write a program to add two numbers or print my name, or print todays date. Basically these are just instructions I will have to give the computer instructions to do this and it would be hard to to write this in 0s and 1s so the computer can understand it (because computers only understand 0s and 1s). ***This is why we have programming languages, so we can write these instructions in a human readable format.***
